### EfficientNet (Part 2) | Kaggle

EfficientNet (Tan & Le, 2019) was published at ICML 2019. The paper proposes a new family of models that are both smaller and faster to train than traditional convolutional neural networks.

### Probing Neural Network Comprehension of Natural Language Arguments (Part 2) | Kaggle 

BERT (which we read the paper for earlier) has had really impressive success on a number of NLP tasks... but how well is it really capturing the structures of natural language? 

We're starting off on  "Probing Neural Network Comprehension of Natural Language Arguments" (Niven & Kao, 2019).
